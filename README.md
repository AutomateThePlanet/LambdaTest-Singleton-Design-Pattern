:question: **What is this Repository About?**

In software development, especially in the optimization of automated testing frameworks, the Singleton design pattern plays a pivotal role. This pattern ensures the creation of only one instance of a class, such as a shared resource manager or toolset, making it accessible globally within the application. This approach is invaluable in automated testing, where consistent and streamlined handling of web pages or shared resources is crucial.

**What Will You Gain?**

- **Introduction to the Singleton Design Pattern:** Uncover the basics of the Singleton pattern and its critical importance in the context of automated testing. Learn why having a single instance of a class across the application can lead to more efficient and manageable testing processes.
- **Optimizing Page Object Models with Singleton:** Dive into the application of the Singleton pattern for page object models, reducing redundancy and improving test execution speed.
- **Broadening Singleton Application:** Explore the use of Singleton in various automated testing scenarios, including factories, repositories, and builders, to ensure efficient and maintainable tests.

**:key: What is the Singleton Design Pattern?**

The Singleton Design Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is especially useful in automated testing for managing shared resources like web drivers, configurations, or page objects efficiently. Singleton helps maintain a consistent state across tests, reducing overhead and enhancing the performance of the test suite. By integrating the Singleton pattern into automated testing strategies, tests become not only quicker and more dependable but also significantly easier to maintain and scale.

### Steps to Run Tests Locally in Visual Studio with C#

1. **Open the Project:** Launch Visual Studio and open your C# project.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - **Single Test Method:** Right-click on the test method name > `Run Tests`.
   - **All Tests in a Test Class:** Right-click on the test class file > `Run Tests`.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest

To execute tests on LambdaTest, you need to set up environment variables in your Visual Studio test configurations:

- `LT_USERNAME` with your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` with your LambdaTest access key.

### Configuring Test Settings in Visual Studio

1. **Access Test Settings:** Navigate to `Test` > `Configure Run Settings` > `Select Solution Wide runsettings File` for broader configurations or use the `Test Explorer` context menu for specific settings.
2. **Set Environment Variables:** In your `.runsettings` file or through the Test Explorer context menu, add your LambdaTest credentials.
   - Include `<EnvironmentVariables>` in your `.runsettings` file with `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` values.

### Viewing Test Results

Test results are available in the `Test Explorer` window, providing information on passed and failed tests, execution times, and detailed error messages.
